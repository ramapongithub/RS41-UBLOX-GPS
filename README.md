How to use a Vaisala RS-41 radiosonde Ublox GPS as an standalone GPS receiver.

GPS-Modules are cheap today. But you also can get them for free, they are falling from the sky.
Every day dozens of radiosondes start. The modern ones, like Graw DFM-09 or Vaisala RS-41, have an GPSR integrated.
This GPSRs can be reused.  An instruction, how to use the GPRS from an Graw DFM-09 is online. (http://happysat.nl/DFM-09/DFM09.html)

Here we will do the same for an Vaisala RS-41.

First you need the radiosonde.
Don't have one? Look at https://radiosondy.info/index.php where they are coming down.

Next step: Disassemble the radiosonde.

If you are down to the PCB and interested in more informations, have a look at bazjos repository at https://github.com/bazjo/RS41_Hardware.

The GPRS occupies only this part of the PCB on the front side,
